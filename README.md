# NIF-Ontology
Repository for the development NIF Standard (NIFSTD) Ontologies.

This repository is currently a work in progress and will be undergoing
significant changes as we transition NIFSTD to git.

If you need a stable version see http://ontology.neuinfo.org/NIF/.

# NOTICE
All ontology files outside the [ttl](ttl) folder will no longer be updated.
A final release of the old owl form of the ontology will be created in the near future.
If you want to make modifications please edit files in [ttl](ttl).
In the future the file hierarchy seen in the `ttl` folder will have its root in the repository root.
