,,,,," This ontology contain what was formally known as BIRNLex-CogSenseBehavior version 1.3.1. -- The BIRN Project lexicon will provide entities for data and database annotation for the BIRN project, covering anatomy, disease, data collection, project management and experimental design.  It is built using the organizational framework provided by the foundational Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).  It uses an abstract biomedical layer on top of that - OBO-UBO which has been constructed  as a proposal to the OBO Foundry.  This is meant to support creating a sharable view of core biomedical objects such as biomaterial_entity, and organismal_entity that all biomedical ontologies are likely to need and want to use with the same intended meaning.  The BIRNLex-Main.owl ontology imports the several domain specific ontology modues required to construct a formal ontology for the multiscale investigation of neurological disease.

This is the second iteration of this mechanism (first was put in v1.2.2).  This second version follows a patter recommended by Alan Ruttenberg which avoids using ObjectProperties as the Manchester design pattern for Value Partitions recommends, and instead sticks to AnnotationProperties only.  Note this version of OBO_annotation_properties uses the same EnumerationClasses from v1.2.2, and still includes the related ObjectProperties, so as to be able to support XSLT-based translation of the BIRNLex files that used the v1.2.2 pattern.  The next version of this file will eliminate the ObjectProperties and will rename the equivalent AnnotationProperties to remove the trailing '2' put in there to provide a unique name.; Have 'cleansed' the file to be OWL-DL (v1.2.2).; Filled out and reconciled the sensory sensation and transduction classes, collating them against UMLS, MeSH, and GO - also adding external IDs for each of those sources.; Adjusted some disjoints and restrictions, so the the ontology would pass Pellet consistency tests. Adjusted mereological relaions for certain types of memory to link them to appropriate sensory perceptions and behavioral activties (BB: 2007-10-04).; v1.3.0 (2007-08-18) - Changed many things, but primarily: (1) removed rdf:datatype xsd:string specs for all AnnotationProperties, since they are now all untyped and should assume STRING as a the default; (2) added the typing of AnnotationProperties using annotationType which should aid in algorithmically processing; (3) Also updated the XSLT BIRNLex cleanser to clean up more Protege mangling and provide a fixed order for certain properties.  This last tool is brittle, as it probably will require continued maintenance to handle more complex OWL constructs than we know have in the file - especially highly nested constructs using class axioms; (4) added use of hasReferenceURLTemplate for linking IDs; (5) Added many more concepts to cover NIF and other BIRN requirements."," The BIRN project lexicon+ontology"," Amarnath Gupta; Maryann Martone; Bill Bug; Jeff Grethe; Jessica Turner; Christine Fennema-Notestine; David Kennedy; Carol Bean"," en"," The BIRN Ontology Task Force",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These certainly are dispositions inhering in the entity performing the activity.  There are also many behavioral activities where it really is a non-sequetor to call them behavioral functions - e.g., 'smoking' is certainly a behavior, but it really makes little sense to represent a 'smoking function' and underlying 'smoking process.' Describing behavior as an activity to which an entity is disposed makes it possible to represent very complex behaviors for which the corresponding behavioral function(s) and underlying process(es) are not yet characterized.  Note also that one can describe the activity without proscribing the associated function and underlying process - e.g., ants and humans can both be said to be disposed toward expressing 'locomotive behavior', and, yet, the associated 'locomotor function' and underlying 'locomotor process' in each organism is very different.  Note also that behavior in general is not restricted to organic 'living' entities but can also be expressed by 'non-living' entities such as the old 'bobbing bird' toy or an automatic loom.  Specific entities may have specific dispositions for expressing certain sets of behavioral activities (BB:2007-03-05).",," The has_integral_part restriction can be used to define complex activities that include a specific sensory component, such as a stimulus-triggered type of activity, where the stimulus targets one or more sensory modalities This restriction is not required or defining, but it declares what other continuants can be associated with a type of behavioral activity to create more complex activities.  Right now, that is limited to sensory perception associated with a particular sensory stimulus.  It's possible this is not quite the right type of obo_ro mereological relation, but it seemed like an appropriate start.  When a sensory perception is involved in an activity, it would be hard to refer to that disposition as a proper_part, though possibly this should just fall back to the more generic obo_ro:part_of (BB).",,,,," C0004927"," http://ontology.neuinfo.org/NIF/Backend/BIRNLex_annotation_properties.owl#uncurated"," http://ontology.neuinfo.org/NIF/Backend/BIRNLex_annotation_properties.owl#Bill_Bug"," Behavioral activity",," 2007-03-06"," 2007-08-22"," http://ontology.neuinfo.org/NIF/Backend/OBO_annotation_properties.owl#UMLS_defSource",,,," * Behavior; the actions or reactions of an object or organism, usually in relation to the environment or surrounding world of stimuli.

In animals, stimuli come from labyrinth system of the inner ears, monitoring the direction of motion; visual stimuli, with information on orientation and motion; pressure receptors, which tell the organism which body surfaces are in contact with the ground; and proprioceptive cues, which report which parts of the body are in motion.
