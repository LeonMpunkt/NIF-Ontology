editorialNote: The current (2006-10-10) members of the BIRN Ontology Task Force are listed here as the primary curators of the main BIRNLex ontology.  Others from within BIRN labs and directly collaborating with BIRN labs have also contributed to specific classes and class properties.  Effort is made to provide attribution for each class, where appropriate.
editorialNote: next ID: birnlex_15000
editorialNote: ID use: 1800 - 1914; 2500 - 2512
title: NIF-Function (formerlly BIRNLex-CogBehavior)
definition: This ontology contain what was formally known as BIRNLex-CogSenseBehavior version 1.3.1. -- The BIRN Project lexicon will provide entities for data and database annotation for the BIRN project, covering anatomy, disease, data collection, project management and experimental design.  It is built using the organizational framework provided by the foundational Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).  It uses an abstract biomedical layer on top of that - OBO-UBO which has been constructed  as a proposal to the OBO Foundry.  This is meant to support creating a sharable view of core biomedical objects such as biomaterial_entity, and organismal_entity that all biomedical ontologies are likely to need and want to use with the same intended meaning.  The BIRNLex-Main.owl ontology imports the several domain specific ontology modues required to construct a formal ontology for the multiscale investigation of neurological disease.  This particular module contains entities related to the behavior and cognitive capabilities and actions of organisms (BB:2007-03-05).
changeNote: Processed file with XSLT to remove the explicit DataTypeProperty declarations (v1.2.2)
changeNote: Now using a specific set of AnnotationProperties that link to specific Enumeration classes to specify annotations from a fixed list of values - e.g., ExternalSource, DefinitionSource.  This is the second iteration of this mechanism (first was put in v1.2.2).  This second version follows a patter recommended by Alan Ruttenberg which avoids using ObjectProperties as the Manchester design pattern for Value Partitions recommends, and instead sticks to AnnotationProperties only.  Note this version of OBO_annotation_properties uses the same EnumerationClasses from v1.2.2, and still includes the related ObjectProperties, so as to be able to support XSLT-based translation of the BIRNLex files that used the v1.2.2 pattern.  The next version of this file will eliminate the ObjectProperties and will rename the equivalent AnnotationProperties to remove the trailing '2' put in there to provide a unique name.
changeNote: Have 'cleansed' the file to be OWL-DL (v1.2.2).
changeNote: Filled out and reconciled the sensory sensation and transduction classes, collating them against UMLS, MeSH, and GO - also adding external IDs for each of those sources.
changeNote: Adjusted some disjoints and restrictions, so the the ontology would pass Pellet consistency tests. Adjusted mereological relaions for certain types of memory to link them to appropriate sensory perceptions and behavioral activties (BB: 2007-10-04).
changeNote: v1.3.0 (2007-08-18) - Changed many things, but primarily: (1) removed rdf:datatype xsd:string specs for all AnnotationProperties, since they are now all untyped and should assume STRING as a the default; (2) added the typing of AnnotationProperties using annotationType which should aid in algorithmically processing; (3) Also updated the XSLT BIRNLex cleanser to clean up more Protege mangling and provide a fixed order for certain properties.  This last tool is brittle, as it probably will require continued maintenance to handle more complex OWL constructs than we know have in the file - especially highly nested constructs using class axioms; (4) added use of hasReferenceURLTemplate for linking IDs; (5) Added many more concepts to cover NIF and other BIRN requirements.

* Echolocation is the method used by some animals (e.g. bats, dolphins and some whales) to determine the location of something by measuring the time it takes for an echo to return from it. These animals emit sound waves and listen for the echo, calculating the distance to the object from the time lapse between sound emission and the echo returning.

editorialNote: This seems a bit contrived but appears to be an appropriate way to classify the sub-classes of behavioral activity derived from this class.  These certainly are dispositions inhering in the entity performing the activity.  There are also many behavioral activities where it really is a non-sequetor to call them behavioral functions - e.g., 'smoking' is certainly a behavior, but it really makes little sense to represent a 'smoking function' and underlying 'smoking process.' Describing behavior as an activity to which an entity is disposed makes it possible to represent very complex behaviors for which the corresponding behavioral function(s) and underlying process(es) are not yet characterized.  Note also that one can describe the activity without proscribing the associated function and underlying process - e.g., ants and humans can both be said to be disposed toward expressing 'locomotive behavior', and, yet, the associated 'locomotor function' and underlying 'locomotor process' in each organism is very different.  Note also that behavior in general is not restricted to organic 'living' entities but can also be expressed by 'non-living' entities such as the old 'bobbing bird' toy or an automatic loom.  Specific entities may have specific dispositions for expressing certain sets of behavioral activities (BB:2007-03-05).

changeNote: The has_integral_part restriction can be used to define complex activities that include a specific sensory component, such as a stimulus-triggered type of activity, where the stimulus targets one or more sensory modalities This restriction is not required or defining, but it declares what other continuants can be associated with a type of behavioral activity to create more complex activities.  Right now, that is limited to sensory perception associated with a particular sensory stimulus.  It's possible this is not quite the right type of obo_ro mereological relation, but it seemed like an appropriate start.  When a sensory perception is involved in an activity, it would be hard to refer to that disposition as a proper_part, though possibly this should just fall back to the more generic obo_ro:part_of (BB).

externallySourcedDefinition: The series of events required for an organism to receive a fast pain stimulus, convert it to a molecular signal, and recognize and characterize the signal. Fast pain is often subjectively described as a sharp or stabbing pain; in humans, the signals from a fast pain stimulus are perceived and relayed along myelinated A-delta fibers to the central nervous system, reaching their target in about 0.1 seconds.

tempDefinition: inductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which the premises of an argument are believed to support the conclusion but do not ensure it. It is used to ascribe properties or relations to types based on tokens (i.e., on one or a small number of observations or experiences); or to formulate laws based on limited observations of recurring phenomenal patterns. Induction is used, for example, in USING SPECIFIC PROPOSITIONS such as:'this ice is cold'; 'a billiard ball moves when struck with a cue' TO INFER GENERAL PROPOSITIONS such as:'all ice is cold'; 'all billiard balls struck with a cue move.' In other words, inductive reasoning infers probable antecedents as a result of observing multiple consequents - i.e., inferring some 'b' from multiple instantiations of 'a' when 'b' entails 'a'..

editorialNote: The examples are derived from the Wikipedia page on 'Mental function.'  Perhaps a more narrow set of examples that specifically fit to our requirements in BIRN would be more appropriate.  A more authoritative neuropsychological source should also be used, as some of these examples may be considered by neuropsychologists to be degenerate - e.g., 'belief function' is_a 'imaginative function' (BB:2007-03-05).
editorialNote: Note that we are distinguishing between processes and functions, so there will appear to be a set of duplicate classes.  The distinction as described by BFO, as we understand it, is that functions are end-directed activities of continuants.  So memory function is an end activity of a memory process.  We therefore measure memory function as an indicator of the effectiveness of the memory process.
hasBirnlexCurator: http://ontology.neuinfo.org/NIF/Backend/BIRNLex_annotation_properties.owl#Bill_Bug
scopeNote: A specific instance of engaging a cognitive function leads to the creation of a mental event distinct from the cognitive functional process itself. The event of perceiving something, for instance, is different from the perceptual process in its entirety, the overall ability to perceive things. In other words, an instance of perceiving is different from the cognitive function that makes it possible (BB:2007-03-05 - derived from Wikipedia).

birnlexDefinition: A behavioral activity employing verbal function to either generate or interpreting meaningful spoken or writen words or symbols.  If generating verbal output, a motor system is invoked.  If interpreting verbal input, typically a sensory system is invoked, though certain interpretive activity involves movement of the sensory organ - e.g., eye movements during reading (BB:2007-03-05).

comment: I'm not sure that the examples given were consistent with the synonym "eating". Rather, these activities are part of and activity that is "feeding/eating". So I deleted them.

tempDefinition: Abductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a hypothesis is chosen to best explain the relevant evidence - also called 'inference to the best explanation'. Abduction starts from a set of accepted facts and infers to their most likely, or best, explanations. The term abduction is also sometimes used to just mean the generation of hypotheses to explain observations or conclusions. Abductive reasoning allows inferring 'a' as an explanation of 'b'. Because of this, abduction allows the precondition 'a' of 'a entails b' to be inferred from the consequence, and, as such, such abduction is formally equivalent to the logical fallacy 'affirming the consequent.' (Wikipedia - BB:2007-03-05).

If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. In deductive reasoning, the conclusion is dependent on its premises. That is, a false premise can possibly lead to a false conclusion, and inconclusive premises will also yield an inconclusive conclusion (Wikipedia - BB:2007-03-05).

tempDefinition: Sensory system functions consist of the variety of capabilities for transducing external stimuli into internal receptive signals for which the organism's nervous system is the primary enabling organ system.  As such sensory functions can be said to inhere in the nervous system.  Sensory system functions usual lead through the action of complex nervous system circuitry to higher level cognitive perception such as a visual image, a smell, a taste, etc.

editorialNote: Though the CSP definition given refers to a process (which will exist separately in BIRNLex as an occurent), this is the closest definition that captures the sense of a function part of the nervous system.   The several other definitions relate more specifically only to the direct sensation component of overall auditory system function.

definition: A cognitive function that controls and regulates other abilities and behaviors. Executive functions include the ability to initiate and stop actions, to monitor and change behavior as needed, and to plan future behavior when faced with novel tasks and situations. Executive functions allow us to anticipate outcomes and adapt to changing situations. The ability to form concepts and think abstractly are often considered components of executive function.
