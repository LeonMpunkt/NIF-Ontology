* A model for semantic anatomical regions and parcellation anatomical regions
  This file documents the logical basis for the [[https://github.com/SciCrunch/NIF-Ontology/blob/master/ttl/generated/parcellation.ttl][NIFSTD parcellation schemes]]
  and their mappings to a variety of semantic anatomical schemes.
  Of these [[https://uberon.org][Uberon]] is of greatest interest.
  Please see https://github.com/SciCrunch/NIF-Ontology/issues/49 for history and current developments.

* Spatial definitions
  #+NAME: table:spatial
  #+CAPTION: Spatial definitions
  | Name (Symbols)     | Anatomical Entities (Beings)       | Spatial definition                                                     | Examples                                     |
  |--------------------+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
  | semantic label     | semantic anatomical region         |                                                                        | Uberon, BrainInfo, Swanson                   |
  | semantic label     | semantic spatial anatomical region | A point or unbounded connected spatial volume that contains that point |                                              |
  | parcellation label | probabilistic parcellation region  | A probabilistically bounded connected spatial volume                   | JÃ¼lich histological, Harvard-Oxford cortical |
  | parcellation label | anatomical parcellation region     | A bounded connected spatial volume [fn:1]                              | Allen MBA CCFv3                              |

[fn:1] As long as the 3d volume is topoligically equivalent to a sphere unconnected regions
in planes of section are fine.

* Universality
  A concept is universal [fn:0] up to an agreement-group under a relationship if it is possible
  to find some other-concept such that there is a group of people who all mutually agree
  about the existence of the other-concept all of whom that use the concept also agree
  that the relationship holds between it and the other-concept.
  
  Alternately, if you can find anything that a group can agree about and some relationship,
  then any additional concept that is used by a subset of that group is universal under that
  relationship for the whole group if everyone in that subset agrees about the relationship
  between the additional concept and the thing the whole group agrees about.
  
  For example, it is probably fair to say that 'thalamus' is universal under partonomy
  up to the group of all people who agree about what a brain is. For any group of people
  who know and agree about what a brain is and that also know what a thalamus is they
  will agree that a thalamus is part of a brain.
  
  Universality is a more general way of expressing that it is possible to find common ground.
  Everyone does not have to agree about whether the thalamus is part of the forbrain or the
  midbrain for the concept to be universal under partonomy, since they all agree that it is
  indeed part of the brain.
  
  Universality does not mean that a term is correct or true, only that it is used consistently
  within a specific group.

  Universality is useful for identifying terminology that is not consistent.
  If there is someone in an agreement group for the spinal cord, but they disagree
  about whether a dorsal root gangion is part of the spinal cord (avoiding circular
  definitions that define it as such) then the dorsal root ganglion is not universal
  under partonomy for that agreement group about the spinal cord.
  
  To give the example that inspired this. If someone uses an Allen Mouse Brain Atlas label
  to refer to a rat brain region the, term (or perhaps that useage) is not universal under
  partonomy. Despite mutual agreement about what a mouse brain is and a rat brain
  is, I do not agree that something that names part of a mouse brain can name something
  that is part of a rat brain. This would also be true for rodent brains and brains generally.
  
[fn:0] This should probably be 'minimally universal'. Maximally universal under a
realationship would be finding that the set of concept other-concept pairs for the
concept in question were the same for all members of the agreement group.

** Semantic region 
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket
   given all people
   an agreement-group about 'thing
   is any member of {subset-of-people in (powerset people) | (mutually-agree? subset-of-people '(exists? 'thing))}
   a 'semantic-region is-said-to-be universal up to an agreement-group iff
   there-exists some 'other-region such-that
   for members of an agreement-group about 'other-region
   {person in members | (uses-term-for? person 'semantic-region)}  ; universal agreement group
   is identical to
   {person in members | (agrees? p '(part-of? 'semantic-region 'other-region))}
   ; the set of members that agrees that 'semantic-region is part-of other-region
   #+END_SRC
   In english.
   A semantic anatomical region is said to be universal up to an agreement group
   if and only if it is possible to find some other region such that all of the
   people who agree about the definition of that other region also agree that
   the region in question is part of that other region.
  
** Semantic spatial region
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket
   a 'semantic-spatial-region is universal iff
   it is a 'semantic-region that is universal up to an agreement-group and
   there-exists some 'point in space such-that
   for-all 'person in the agreement-group that also use the term  ; universal-agreement-group maybe?
   (agrees? 'person '(contained-in? 'semantic-spatial-region 'point))
   #+END_SRC
   In english.
   A semantic spatial region is universal if and only iff it is a universal semantic
   region and all the people in the universal agreement group can agree on at least
   one real spatial location (point) that they all agree is contained in the region
   in question.

** Parcellation region (and probabilistic parcellation regions)
   Universality is derived from the spatial structure of the atlas and the species
   and developmental stage for which they are defined, as long as the subjects being
   registered meet those criteria.

   The full explication of the criteria need to support universality is more complex
   and includes quite a bit of provenance information about the processes used to
   determine whether the atlas is applicable for the subject in question.
   However, for the purposes of communication we don't need to dig further for now.
