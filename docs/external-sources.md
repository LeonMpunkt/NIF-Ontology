# External sources
Sometimes you don't need a new OWL2 ontology!

# Software Licenses
## Gentoo
Gentoo maintains an extremely complete listing of open and closed software
[licenses](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/tree/master/licenses).
I highly reccomend building off the existing efforts there and
contributing new software liceneses there as well.
## SPDX
Another source for licenses is the [Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) project](https://spdx.org/)
which maintains this [list](https://spdx.org/licenses/) with short identifiers.
See [their docs](accesshttps://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/blob/master/accessingLicenses.md)
for how to access these programatically. It is possible to use that repository to build a
license ontology file. I cannot seem to find an RDF file which provides just the license data
but there must be one around somewhere.

NOTE: licenses are NOT data or resource terms of use!
