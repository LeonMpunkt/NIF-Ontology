# External sources
Sometimes you don't need a new OWL2 ontology!

# Software Licenses
Gentoo maintains an extremely complete listing of open and closed software
[licenses](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/tree/master/licenses).
I highly reccomend building off the existing efforts there and
contributing new software liceneses there as well.

NOTE: licenses are NOT data or resource terms of use!
